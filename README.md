# Credit-Risk
1. Conducted an in-depth comparative analysis of machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. 

2. Identified and selected key variables that significantly contribute to prediction using the Information Value parameter. 

3. Removed Multicollinearity using the Variance Inflation Factor and dealt with
Imbalanced data using SMOTE.

4. Evaluated the model based on accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-curve,
to gauge their performance in predicting credit risk.
